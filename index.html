            <h3>Mechanical Design Engineer and Web Developer</h3>
            <p class="pad">
                My dream is to design new mechanical products that can be used to ease human life and make life more
                comfortable. Making proper design and simulating them can be very useful for becoming professional
                mechanical product designer.
                Web dedvelopment is another profession that I look for as a hobby. I like making websites and want to
                work as a front end developer.
